  abstract = {Effective energy management for large campus facilities is becoming increasingly complex as modern heating and cooling systems comprise of several hundred subsystems interconnected to each other. Building energy simulators like EnergyPlus are exceedingly good at modeling a single building equipped with a standalone HVAC equipment. However, the ability to simulate a large campus and to control the dynamics and interactions of the subsystems is limited or missing altogether. In this paper, we use the Matlab-EnergyPlus MLE+ tool we developed, to extend the capability of EnergyPlus to co-simulate a campus with multiple buildings connected to a chilled water distribution to a central chiller plant with control systems in Matlab. We present the details of how this simulation can be set-up and implemented using MLE+'s Matlab/Simulink block. We utilize the virtual campus test-bed to evaluate the performance of several demand response strategies. We also describe a coordinated demand response scheme which can lead to load curtailment during a demand response event while minimizing thermal discomfort.}

  abstract = {Left atrial voltage maps are routinely acquired during electroanatomic mapping in patients undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). For patients, who have prior catheter ablation when they are in sinus rhythm (SR), the voltage map can be used to identify low voltage areas (LVAs) using a threshold of 0.2 - 0.45 mV. However, such a voltage threshold for maps acquired during AF has not been well established. A prerequisite for defining a voltage threshold is to maximize the topologically matched LVAs between the electroanatomic mapping acquired during AF and SR. This paper demonstrates a new technique to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the matched LVA. This is achieved by computing omni-directional bipolar voltages and applying Gaussian Process Regression based interpolation to derive the AF map. The proposed method is evaluated on a test cohort of 7 male patients, and a total of 46,589 data points were included in analysis. The LVAs in the posterior left atrium and pulmonary vein junction are determined using the standard method and the proposed method. Overall, the proposed method showed patient-specific sensitivity and specificity in matching LVAs of 75.70% and 65.55% for a geometric mean of 70.69%. On average, there was an improvement of 3.00% in the geometric mean, 7.88% improvement in sensitivity, 0.30% improvement in specificity compared to the standard method. The results show that the proposed method is an improvement in matching LVA. This may help develop the voltage threshold to better identify LVA in the left atrium for patients in AF.}

  abstract = {In multi-agent systems, robots transmit their planned trajectories to each other or to a central controller, and each receiver plans its own actions by maximizing a measure of mission satisfaction. For missions expressed in temporal logic, the robustness function plays the role of satisfaction measure. Currently, a Piece-Wise Linear (PWL) or piece-wise constant reconstruction is used at the receiver. This allows an efficient robustness computation algorithm - a.k.a. monitoring - but is not adaptive to the signal class of interest, and does not leverage the compression properties of more general representations. When communication capacity is at a premium, this is a serious bottleneck. In this paper we first show that the robustness computation is significantly affected by how the continuous-time signal is reconstructed from the received samples, which can mean the difference between a successful control and a crash. We show that monitoring general spline-based reconstructions yields a smaller robustness error, and that it can be done with the same time complexity as monitoring the simpler PWL reconstructions. Thus robustness computation can now be adapted to the signal class of interest. We further show that the monitoring error is tightly upper-bounded by the L ∞ signal reconstruction error. We present a (non-linear) L ∞ -based scheme which yields even lower monitoring error than the spline-based schemes (which have the advantage of being faster to compute), and illustrate all results on two case studies. As an application of these results, we show how time-frequency specifications can be efficiently monitored online.}

Advances in computer modeling and simulation allow for generation of a simulated cohort or virtual cohort which mimics a patient population and can be used as a source of prior information. A major obstacle to acceptance of simulation results as a source of prior information is the lack of a framework for explicitly modeling sources of uncertainty in simulation results and quantifying the effect on trial outcomes.

In this work, we formulate the Computer-Aided Clinical Trial (CACT) within a Bayesian statistical framework allowing explicit modeling of assumptions and utilization of simulation results at all stages of a clinical trial. To quantify the robustness of the CACT outcome with respect to a simulation assumption, we define δ-robustness as the minimum perturbation of the base prior distribution resulting in a change of the CACT outcome and provide a method to estimate the δ-robustness.

We demonstrate the utility of the framework and how the results of δ-robustness evaluation can be utilized at various stages of a clinical trial through an application to the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT), which was a comparative evaluation of the safety and efficacy of specific software algorithms across different implantable cardiac devices. Finally, we introduce a hardware interface that allows for direct interaction with the physical device in order to validate and confirm the results of a CACT for implantable cardiac devices.}

  abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems must withstand a wide range of errors, from bugs in their software to attacks on their physical sensors. Given a formal specification of their desired behavior in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), the robust semantics of the specification provides a notion of system robustness that can be calculated directly on the output behavior of the system, without explicit reference to the various sources or models of the errors. The robustness of the MTL specification has been used both to verify the system offline (via robustness minimization) and to control the system online (to maximize its robustness over some horizon). Unfortunately, the robustness objective function is difficult to work with: it is recursively defined, non-convex and non-differentiable. In this paper, we propose smooth approximations of the robustness. Such approximations are differentiable, thus enabling us to use powerful off-the- shelf gradient descent algorithms for optimizing it. By using them we can also offer guarantees on the performance of the optimization in terms of convergence to minima. We show that the approximation error is bounded to any desired level, and that the approximation can be tuned to the specification. We demonstrate the use of the smooth robustness to control two quad-rotors in an autonomous air traffic control scenario, and for temperature control of a building for comfort.}

Specifically, we study an architecture called the "Wireless Control Network'' (WCN), where each wireless node maintains a state, and periodically updates it as a linear combination of neighboring plant outputs and node states. This architecture has previously been shown to have low computational overhead and beneficial scheduling and compositionality properties. In this paper we characterize fundamental topological conditions to allow stabilization using such a scheme. To achieve this, we exploit the fact that the WCN scheme causes the network to act as a linear dynamical system, and analyze the coupling between the plant's dynamics and the dynamics of the network. We show that stabilizing control inputs can be computed in-network if the vertex connectivity of the network is larger than the geometric multiplicity of any unstable eigenvalue of the plant. This condition is analogous to the typical min-cut condition required in classical information dissemination problems. Furthermore, we specify equivalent topological conditions for stabilization over a wired (or point-to-point) network that employs network coding in a traditional way -- as a communication mechanism between the plant's sensors and decentralized controllers at the actuators.}

Under the widely adopted peak-demand pricing policy, electricity customers are charged a very high price for their maximum demand to discourage their energy usage in peak load conditions. In buildings, peak demand is often the result of temporally correlated energy demand surges caused by uncoordinated operation of sub-systems such as heating, ventilating, air conditioning and refrigeration (HVAC&R) systems and lighting systems. We have previously presented green scheduling as an approach to schedule the building control systems within a constrained peak demand envelope while ensuring that custom climate conditions are facilitated. This paper provides a sufficient schedulability condition for the peak constraint to be realizable for a large and practical class of system dynamics that can capture certain nonlinear dynamics, inter-dependencies, and constrained disturbances. We also present a method for synthesizing periodic schedules for the system. The proposed method is demonstrated in a simulation example to be scalable and effective for a large-scale system.}

  abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for closed-loop model checking of medical devices, and illustrates it with a case study on implantable
cardiac pacemakers. To evaluate the performance of a medical device on
the human body, a model of the device’s physiological environment must be
developed, and the closed-loop consisting of device (e.g., pacemaker) and
environment (e.g., the human heart) is model-checked. Formal modeling of
the environment and its application in model checking pose several challenges that are addressed in this paper. Pacemakers should guarantee safe
operations across large varieties of heart conditions, which are represented
by an incomplete set of timed automata models. A set of domain-specific
abstraction rules are developed that can over-approximate the timing behaviors of a heart model or a group of heart models, such that the new
behaviors introduced by abstraction are mostly physiologically meaningful.
The rules serve as a systematic method to cover heart conditions that may
not be explicitly accounted for in the initial set of heart models. Closed-loop
model checking is systematically performed using the heart models in the
abstraction tree, to obtain the most concrete counter-example(s) that correspond to property violation. These counter-examples, along with their
physiological context, are then presented to the physician to determine
their physiological validity. The proposed methodology creates a separation between steps requiring physiological domain expertise (model creation and abstraction rules definition) and steps that can be automated
(rule application, model checking, and abstraction refinement). While the
methodology is illustrated for pacemaker verification, it is more broadly
applicable to the verification of other medical devices.}

Learning models of buildings from sensor data has a fundamental property that the model can only be as accurate and reliable as the data on which it was trained. For small and medium size buildings, a low-cost method for model capture is necessary to take advantage of optimal model-based supervisory control schemes. We present IMpACT, a methodology and a toolbox for analysis of uncertainty propagation for building inverse modeling and controls. Given a plant model and real input data, IMpACT automatically evaluates the effect of the uncertainty propagation from sensor data to model accuracy and control performance. We also present a statistical method to quantify the bias in the sensor measurement and to determine near optimal sensor placement and density for accurate signal measurements. In our previous work, we considered the end-to-end propagation of uncertainty in the form of fixed bias in the sensor data. In this paper, we extend the method to work with random errors in the sensor data, which is more realistic. Using a real building test-bed, we show how performing an uncertainty analysis can reveal trends about inverse model accuracy and control performance, which can be used to make informed decisions about sensor requirements and data accuracy.}

Because driving a real AV that many miles is too slow and costly, this motivates the use of sophisticated `world simulators', which present the AV's perception pipeline with realistic input scenes, and present the AV's control stack with realistic traffic and physics to which to react. Thus the simulator is a crucial piece of any CAD toolchain for AV testing. In this work, we build a test harness for driving an arbitrary AV's code in a simulated world. We demonstrate this harness by using the game Grand Theft Auto V (GTA) as world simulator for AV testing.
Namely, our AV code, for both perception and control, interacts in real-time with the game engine to drive our AV in the GTA world, and we search for weather conditions and AV operating conditions that lead to dangerous situations. This goes beyond the current state-of-the-art where AVs are tested under ideal weather conditions, and lays the ground work for a more comprehensive testing effort. We also propose and demonstrate necessary analyzes to validate the simulation results relative to the real world. The results of such analyses allow the designers and verification engineers to weigh the results of simulation-based testing.}

To provide optimal control for such closed-loop systems, model-based controls require accurate physical plant models. It is hard to analytically establish (a) how data quality from sensors affects model accuracy, and consequently, (b) the effect of model accuracy on the operational cost of model-based controllers. We present the Model-IQ toolbox which, given a plant model and real input data, automatically evaluates the effect of this uncertainty propagation from sensor data to model accuracy to controller performance. We apply the Model-IQ uncertainty analysis for model-based controls in buildings to demonstrate the cost-benefit of adding temporary sensors to capture a building model. We show how sensor placement and density bias training data. For the real building considered, a bias of 1% degrades model accuracy by 20%. Model-IQ's automated process lowers the cost of sensor deployment, model training and evaluation of advanced controls for small and medium sized buildings. Such end-to-end analysis of uncertainty propagation has the potential to lower the cost for CPS with closed-loop model based control. We demonstrate this with real building data in the Department of Energy's HUB.}

This paper presents data-driven methods for making control-oriented model for peak power reduction in buildings. Specifically, a data predictive control with regression trees (DPCRT) algorithm, is presented. DPCRT is a finite receding horizon method, using which the building operator can optimally trade off peak power reduction against thermal comfort without having to learn white/grey box models of the systems dynamics. We evaluate the performance of our method using a DoE commercial reference virtual test-bed and show how it can be used for learning predictive models with 90% accuracy, and for achieving 8.6% reduction in peak power and costs.}

The main purpose of an artificial pacemaker is to treat bradycardia, or slow heart beats, by pacing the atrium and ventricles at a faster rate. While the basic functionality of the device is fairly simple, there are many documented cases of death and injury due to device malfunctions. The frequency of malfunctions due to firmware problems will only increase as the pacemaker operations become more complex in an attempt to expand the use of the device. One reason these malfunctions arise is that there is currently no methodology for formal validation and verification of medical device software, as there are in the safety-critical domains of avionics and industrial control automation. We have developed a timed-automata based Virtual Heart Model (VHM) to act as platform for medical device software validation and verification. Through a case study involving multiple arrhythmias, this investigation shows how the VHM can be used with closed-loop operation of a pacemaker to validate the necessity and functionality of the complex mode-switch pacemaker operation.

For example, a vision-based robot controller processes large image data from cameras at high frequency to observe the robot’s state in the surrounding environment, which is used to compute control commands. In real-time control systems where large volume of data is processed for feedback control, the data-dependent state estimation can become a computation and communication bottleneck, resulting in potentially degraded control performance. Anytime algorithms, which offer a trade-off between execution time and accuracy of computation, can be leveraged in such systems. We present a Robust Model Predictive Control approach with an Anytime State Estimation Algorithm, which computes both the optimal control signal for the plant and the (time-varying) deadline/accuracy constraint for the anytime estimator. Our approach improves the system’s performance (concerning both the control performance and the estimation cost) over conventional controllers, which are designed for and operate at a fixed computation time/accuracy setting. We numerically evaluate our approach in an idealized motion model for navigation with both state and control constraints.}

To address actuation in closedloop wireless control systems there is a strong need to re-think the communication architectures and protocols for reliability, coordination and control. As the links, nodes and topology of wireless systems are inherently unreliable, such time-critical and safety-critical applications require programming abstractions where the tasks are assigned to the sensors, actuators and controllers as a single component rather than statically mapping a set of tasks to a specific physical node at design time. To this end, we introduce the Embedded Virtual Machine (EVM), a powerful and flexible programming abstraction where virtual components and their properties are maintained across node boundaries. In the context of process and discrete control, an EVM is the distributed runtime system that dynamically selects primary-backup sets of controllers to guarantee QoS given spatial and temporal constraints of the underlying wireless network. The EVM architecture defines explicit mechanisms for control, data and fault communication within the virtual component. EVM-based algorithms introduce new capabilities such as predictable outcomes and provably minimal graceful degradation during sensor/actuator failure, adaptation to mode changes and runtime optimization of resource consumption. Through the design of a natural gas process plant hardware-in-loop simulation we aim to demonstrate the preliminary capabilities of EVM-based wireless networks.}

  abstract = {TUNERCAR is a toolchain that jointly optimizes racing strategy, planning methods, control algorithms, and vehicle parameters for an autonomous racecar. In this paper, we detail the target hardware, software, simulators, and systems infrastructure for this toolchain. Our methodology employs a parallel implementation of CMA-ES which enables simulations to proceed 6 times faster than real-world rollouts. We show our approach can reduce the lap times in autonomous racing, given a fixed computational budget. For all tested tracks, our method provides the lowest lap time, and relative improvements in lap time between 7-21%. We demonstrate improvements over a naive random search method with equivalent computational budget of over 15 seconds/lap, and improvements over expert solutions of over 2 seconds/lap. We further compare the performance of our method against hand-tuned solutions submitted by over 30 international teams, comprised of graduate students working in the field of autonomous vehicles. Finally, we discuss the effectiveness of utilizing an online planning mechanism to reduce the reality gap between our simulation and actual tests.}

  abstract = {Control software of autonomous robots has stringent real-time requirements that must be met to achieve the
control objectives. One source of variability in the performance
of a control system is the execution time and accuracy of
the state estimator that provides the controller with state
information. This estimator is typically perception-based (e.g.,
Computer Vision-based) and is computationally expensive.
When the computational resources of the hardware platform
become overloaded, the estimation delay can compromise control performance and even stability. In this paper, we define
a framework for co-designing anytime estimation and control
algorithms, in a manner that accounts for implementation
issues like delays and inaccuracies. We construct an anytime
perception-based estimator from standard off-the-shelf Computer Vision algorithms, and show how to obtain a trade-off
curve for its delay vs estimate error behavior. We use this
anytime estimator in a controller that can use this tradeoff curve at runtime to achieve its control objectives at a
reduced energy cost. When the estimation delay is too large
for correct operation, we provide an optimal manner in which
the controller can use this curve to reduce estimation delay
at the cost of higher inaccuracy, all the while guaranteeing
basic objectives are met. We illustrate our approach on an
autonomous hexrotor and demonstrate its advantage over a
system that does not exploit co-design.}

  abstract = {The problem of safe planning and control for multi- drone systems across a variety of missions is of critical impor- tance, as the scope of tasks assigned to such systems increases. In this paper, we present an approach to solve this problem for multi-quadrotor missions. Given a mission expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), our controller maximizes robustness to generate trajectories for the quadrotors that satisfy the STL spec- ification in continuous-time. We also show that the constraints on our optimization guarantees that these trajectories can be tracked nearly perfectly by lower level off-the-shelf position and attitude controllers. Our approach avoids the oversimplifying abstractions found in many planning methods, while retaining the expressiveness of missions encoded in STL allowing us to handle complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements. Through experiments, both in simulation and on actual quadrotors, we show the performance, scalability and real-time applicability of our method.}

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have already driven millions of miles on public roads, but even the simplest scenarios have not been certified for safety. Current methodologies for the verification of AV's decision and control systems attempt to divorce the lower level, short-term trajectory planning and trajectory tracking functions from the behavioral rules-based framework that governs mid-term actions. Such analysis is typically predicated on the discretization of the state space and has several limitations. First, it requires that a conservative buffer be added around obstacles such that many feasible plans are classified as unsafe. Second, the discretized controllers modeled in this analysis require several refinement steps before being implementable on an actual AV, and typically do not allow the specification of comfort-related properties on the trajectories. In contrast, consumer-ready AVs use motion planning algorithms that generate smooth trajectories. While viable algorithms exist for the generation of smooth trajectories originating from a single state, analysis should consider that the AV faces state estimation errors and disturbances. Third, verification is restricted to a discretized state space with fixed-size cells; this assumption can artificially limit the set of available trajectories if the discretization is too coarse. Conversely, too fine of a discretization renders the problem intractable for automated analysis. This work presents a new verification tool, APEX, which investigates the combined action of a behavioral planner and state lattice-based motion planner to guarantee a safe vehicle trajectory is chosen. In APEX, decisions made at the behavioral layer can be traced through to the spatio-temporal evolution of the AV and verified. Thus, there is no need to create abstractions of the AV's controllers, and aggressive trajectories required for evasive maneuvers can be accurately investigated.}

  abstract = {The correct and timely completion of the sensing and action loop is of utmost importance in safety critical autonomous systems. A crucial part of the performance of this feedback control loop are the computation time and accuracy of the estimator which produces state estimates used by the controller. These state estimators, especially those used for localization, often use computationally expensive perception algorithms like visual object tracking. With on-board computers on autonomous robots being computationally limited, the computation time of a perception-based estimation algorithm can at times be high enough to result in poor control performance. In this work, we develop a framework for co-design of anytime estimation and robust control algorithms while taking into account computation delays and estimation inaccuracies. This is achieved by constructing a perception-based anytime estimator from an off-the-shelf perception-based estimation algorithm, and in the process we obtain a trade-off curve for its computation time versus estimation error. This information is used in the design of a robust predictive control algorithm that at run-time decides a contract for the estimator, or the mode of operation of estimator, in addition to trying to achieve its control objectives at a reduced computation energy cost. In cases where the estimation delay can result in possibly degraded control performance, we provide an optimal manner in which the controller can use this trade-off curve to reduce estimation delay at the cost of higher inaccuracy, all the while guaranteeing that control objectives are robustly satisfied. Through experiments on a hexrotor platform running a visual odometry algorithm for state estimation, we show how our method results in upto a 10% improvement in control performance while saving 5-6% in computation energy as compared to a method that does not leverage the co-design.}

Feedback linearization has reduced the computational burden, but has not yet been solved for robust model predictive control under estimation errors and constraints. In this paper, we solve this problem of robust control of a non-linear system under bounded state estimation errors and input and state constraints using feedback linearization. We do so by developing robust constraints on the feedback linearized system such that the non-linear system respects its constraints. These constraints are computed at run-time using online reachability, and are linear in the optimization variables, resulting in a Quadratic Program with linear constraints. We also provide robust feasibility, recursive feasibility and stability results for our control algorithm. We evaluate our approach on two systems to show its applicability and performance}

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a model-based technique widely and successfully used over the past years to improve control systems performance. A key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC for complex systems such as buildings is related to the difficulties (cost, time and effort) associated with the identification of a predictive model of a building. To overcome this problem, we introduce a novel idea for predictive control based on historical building data leveraging machine learning algorithms like regression trees and random forests. We call this approach Data-driven model Predictive Control (DPC), and we apply it to three different case studies to demonstrate its performance, scalability, and robustness. In the first case study we consider a benchmark MPC controller using a bilinear building model, then we apply DPC to a data-set simulated from such bilinear model and derive a controller based only on the data. Our results demonstrate that DPC can provide comparable performance with respect to MPC applied to a perfectly known mathematical model. In the second case study, we apply DPC to a 6 story 22 zone building model in EnergyPlus, for which model-based control is not economical and practical due to extreme complexity, and address a Demand Response problem. Our results demonstrate scalability and efficiency of DPC showing that DPC provides the desired power curtailment with an average error of 3%. In the third case study, we implement and test DPC on real data from an off-grid house located in L’Aquila, Italy. We compare the total amount of energy saved with respect to the classical bang-bang controller, showing that we can perform an energy saving up to 49.2%. Our results demonstrate the robustness of our method to uncertainties both in real data acquisition and weather forecast.}

Furthermore, in some cases such as electric vehicles, the load dynamics are fast, not perfectly known in advance and the on-board computation power is often limited, making the implementation of traditional optimal control difficult. We aim to develop a control scheme to reduce the peak power drawn from the source for hybrid energy systems with limited computation power and limited load forecasts. We propose a scheme with two control levels and provide a sufficient condition for control of the different energy storage/generation components to meet the instantaneous load while satisfying a peak power threshold. The scheme provides performance comparable to Model Predictive Control, while requiring less computation power and only coarse-grained load predictions. For a case study, we implement the scheme for a battery-supercapacitor-powered electric vehicle with real world drive cycles to demonstrate the low execution time and effective reduction of the battery power (hence temperature), which is crucial to the lifetime of the battery.}

Using meter and weather data along with set-point schedule information, we use an ensemble of regression trees to learn non-parametric data-driven models for predicting the power consumption of the building. This model can be used for evaluating demand response strategies in real-time, without having to learn complex models of the building. The methods have been integrated in an open-source tool called DR-Advisor, which acts as a recommender system for the building’s facilities manager by advising on which control actions should be during a demand response event. We provide a case study using data from a large commercial vistural test-bed building to evaluate the performance of the DR-Advisor tool.

  abstract = {A fundamental problem in the design of closed-loop Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is in accurately capturing the dynamics of the underlying physical system. To provide optimal control for such closed-loop systems, model-based controls require accurate physical plant models. It is hard to analytically establish (a) how data quality from sensors affects model accuracy, and consequently, (b) the effect of model accuracy on the operational cost of model-based controllers. We present the Model-IQ toolbox which, given a plant model and real input data, automatically evaluates the effect of this uncertainty propagation from sensor data to model accuracy to controller performance. We apply the Model-IQ uncertainty analysis for model-based controls in buildings to demonstrate the cost-benefit of adding temporary sensors to capture a building model. We show how sensor placement and density bias training data. For the real building considered, a bias of 1% degrades model accuracy by 20%. Model-IQ's automated process lowers the cost of sensor deployment, model training and evaluation of advanced controls for small and medium sized buildings. Such end-to-end analysis of uncertainty propagation has the potential to lower the cost for CPS with closed-loop model based control. We demonstrate this with real building data in the Department of Energy's HUB.}

  abstract = {Modern control systems, like controllers for swarms of quadrotors, must satisfy complex control objectives while withstanding a wide range of disturbances, from bugs in their software to attacks on their sensors and changes in their environments. These requirements go beyond stability and tracking, and involve temporal and sequencing constraints on system response to various events. This work formalizes the requirements as formulas in Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), and designs a controller that maximizes the robustness of the MTL formula. Formally, if the system satisfies the formula with robustness r, then any disturbance of size less than r cannot cause it to violate the formula. Because robustness is not differentiable, this work provides arbitrarily precise, infinitely differentiable, approximations of it, thus enabling the use of powerful gradient descent optimizers. Experiments on a temperature control example and a two-quadrotor system demonstrate that this approach to controller design outper- forms existing approaches to robustness maximization based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming and stochastic heuristics. Moreover, it is not constrained to linear systems.}

  abstract = {This paper details the design of an autonomous vehicle CAD toolchain, which captures formal descriptions of driving scenarios in order to develop a safety case for an autonomous vehicle (AV). Rather than focus on a particular component of the AV, like adaptive cruise control, the toolchain models the end-to-end dynamics of the AV in a formal way suitable for testing and verification. First, a domain-specific language capable of describing the scenarios that occur in the day-to-day operation of an AV is defined. The language allows the description and composition of traffic participants, and the specification of formal correctness requirements. A scenario described in this language is an executable that can be processed by a specification-guided automated test generator (bug hunting), and by an exhaustive reachability tool. The toolchain allows the user to exploit and integrate the strengths of both testing and reachability, in a way not possible when each is run alone. Finally, given a particular execution of the scenario that violates the requirements, a visualization tool can display this counter-example and generate labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on five autonomous driving scenarios drawn from a collection of 36 scenarios that account for over 95% of accidents nationwide. These case studies demonstrate robustness-guided verification heuristics to reduce analysis time, counterexample visualization for identifying controller bugs in both the discrete decision logic and low-level analog (continuous) dynamics, and identification of modeling errors that lead to unrealistic environment behavior.}

  abstract = { Control software of autonomous robots has stringent real-time requirements that must be met to achieve the
control objectives. One source of variability in the performance
of a control system is the execution time and accuracy of
the state estimator that provides the controller with state
information. This estimator is typically perception-based (e.g.,
Computer Vision-based) and is computationally expensive.
When the computational resources of the hardware platform
become overloaded, the estimation delay can compromise control performance and even stability. In this paper, we define
a framework for co-designing anytime estimation and control
algorithms, in a manner that accounts for implementation
issues like delays and inaccuracies. We construct an anytime
perception-based estimator from standard off-the-shelf Computer Vision algorithms, and show how to obtain a trade-off
curve for its delay vs estimate error behavior. We use this
anytime estimator in a controller that can use this tradeoff curve at runtime to achieve its control objectives at a
reduced energy cost. When the estimation delay is too large
for correct operation, we provide an optimal manner in which
the controller can use this curve to reduce estimation delay
at the cost of higher inaccuracy, all the while guaranteeing
basic objectives are met. We illustrate our approach on an
autonomous hexrotor and demonstrate its advantage over a
system that does not exploit co-design.}

  abstract = {Safe planning for fleets of Unmaned Aircraft Systems (UAS) performing complex missions in urban environments has typically been a challenging problem. In the United States of America, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have been studying the regulation of the airspace when multiple such fleets of autonomous UAS share the same airspace, outlined in the Concept of Operations document (ConOps). While the focus is on the infrastructure and management of the airspace, the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Traffic Management (UTM) ConOps also outline a potential airspace reservation based system for operation where operators reserve a volume of the airspace for a given time inter- val to operate in, but it makes clear that the safety (separation from other aircraft, terrain, and other hazards) is a responsibility of the drone fleet operators. In this work, we present a tool that allows an operator to plan out missions for fleets of multi-rotor UAS, performing complex time- bound missions. The tool builds upon a correct-by-construction planning method by translating missions to Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Along with a simple user interface, it also has fast and scalable mission planning abilities. We demonstrate our tool for one such mission.}

  abstract = {Digital video content via broadcast television, Internet and other content distribution networks provide limited interaction for fitness and wellness activities. The content delivery is one-way only and provides no personalization to the pace, programming and progress of the user’s exercise routine. Furthermore, the content is to be viewed only on a screen which makes it awkward and incompatible with full-body activities such as yoga, pilates and T’ai chi. We present CloudMat, a system for context-aware personalization of fitness content with cloudenabled connected surfaces. CloudMat provides real-time closedloop feedback between the state of the user on the physical mat and the state of the content in the cloud service. Content is tagged with actuation signals where events are delegated from the screen to display on an electroluminescent lighting layer on the mat, which provides spatial guidance to the end-user. Through the sensor-layer embedded in the mat, the physical interface captures the pose and timing of the user activity and relays it to the Context-aware Personalization cloud service. This service coordinates sensing and actuation between the content stream and mat by generating pose templates and metadata files about the exercise routine to be delivered to the user. Through this interactive process between the physical mat and the content service, the feedback provided by the user performing the routine continuously adapts the pace and programming to maintain the desired user experience. We demonstrate the utility of the system and evaluate the system performance with a case study on interactive yoga.}

In this paper, we present an approach to solve this problem for multi-quadrotor missions. Given a mission expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), our controller maximizes robustness to generate trajectories for the quadrotors that satisfy the STL spec- ification in continuous-time. We also show that the constraints on our optimization guarantees that these trajectories can be tracked nearly perfectly by lower level off-the-shelf position and attitude controllers. Our approach avoids the oversimplifying abstractions found in many planning methods, while retaining the expressiveness of missions encoded in STL allowing us to handle complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements. Through experiments, both in simulation and on actual quadrotors, we show the performance, scalability and real-time applicability of our method.}

  abstract = {Autonomous medical devices such as implantable cardiac pacemakers are capable of diagnosing the patient condition and delivering therapy without human intervention. Their ability to autonomously affect the physiological state of the patient makes them safety-critical. Sufficient evidence for the safety and efficacy of the device software, which makes these autonomous decisions, should be provided before these devices can be released on the market. Formal methods like model checking can provide safety evidence that the devices can safely operate under a large variety of physiological conditions. The challenge is to develop physiological models that are general enough to cover the large variability of human physiology, and also expressive enough to provide physiological contexts to counter-examples returned by the model checker. In this paper, the authors develop a set of physiological abstraction rules that introduce physiological constraints to heart models. By applying these abstraction rules to a initial set of heart models, an abstraction tree is created. The root model covers all possible inputs to a pacemaker and derived models cover inputs from different heart conditions. If a counter-example is returned by the model checker, the abstraction tree is traversed so that the most concrete counter-example(s) with physiological contexts can be returned to the domain experts for validity check. The abstraction tree framework replaces the manual abstraction and refinement framework, which reduced the amount of domain knowledge required to perform closed-loop model checking. It encourages the use of model checking during the development of autonomous medical devices, and identifies safety risks earlier in the design process.}

  abstract = {Ventricular Fibrillation is a disorganized electrical excitation of the heart that results in inadequate blood flow to the body. It usually ends in death within a minute. A common way to treat the symptoms of fibrillation is to implant a medical device, known as an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD), in the patient's body. Model-based verification can supply rigorous proofs of safety and efficacy. In this paper, we build a hybrid system model of the human heart+ICD closed loop, and show it to be a STORMED system, a class of o-minimal hybrid systems that admit finite bisimulations. In general, it may not be possible to compute the bisimulation. We show that approximate reachability can yield a finite simulation for STORMED systems, and that certain compositions respect the STORMED property. The results of this paper are theoretical and motivate the creation of concrete model checking procedures for STORMED systems.}

  abstract = {An Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) is a medical device used for the detection of potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias and their treatment through the delivery of electrical shocks intended to restore normal heart rhythm. An ICD reprogramming attack seeks to alter the device’s parameters to induce unnecessary therapy or prevent required therapy. In this paper, we present a formal approach for the synthesis of ICD reprogramming attacks that are both effective, i.e., lead to fundamental changes in the required therapy, and stealthy, i.e., are hard to detect. We focus on the discrimination algorithm underlying Boston Scientific devices (one of the principal ICD manufacturers) and formulate the synthesis problem as one of multi-objective optimization. Our solution technique is based on an Optimization Modulo Theories encoding of the problem and allows us to derive device parameters that are optimal with respect to the effectiveness-stealthiness trade-off. Our method can be tailored to the patient’s current condition, and readily generalizes to new rhythms. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to derive systematic ICD reprogramming attacks designed to maximize therapy disruption while minimizing detection.}

  abstract = {Relaxed notions of decidability widen the scope of automatic verification of hybrid systems. In quasi-decidability and $\delta$-decidability, the fundamental compromise is that if we are willing to accept a slight error in the algorithm's answer, or a slight restriction on the class of problems we verify, then it is possible to obtain practically useful answers. This paper explores the connections between relaxed decidability and the robust semantics of Metric Temporal Logic formulas. It establishes a formal equivalence between the robustness degree of MTL specifications, and the imprecision parameter $\delta$ used in $\delta$-decidability when it is used to verify MTL properties. We present an application of this result in the form of an algorithm that generates new constraints to the $\delta$-decision procedure from falsification runs, which speeds up the verification run. We then establish new conditions under which robust testing, based on the robust semantics of MTL, is in fact a quasi-semidecision procedure. These results allow us to delimit what is possible with fast, robustness-based methods, accelerate (near-)exhaustive verification, and further bridge the gap between verification and simulation.}

  abstract = {Building physics-based models of complex physical systems like buildings and chemical plants is extremely cost and time prohibitive for applications such as real-time optimal control, production planning and supply chain logistics. Machine learning algorithms can reduce this cost and time complexity, and are, consequently, more scalable for large-scale physical systems. However, there are many practical challenges that must be addressed before employing machine learning for closed-loop control. This paper proposes the use of Gaussian Processes (GP) for learning control-oriented models: (1) We develop methods for the optimal experiment design (OED) of functional tests to learn models of a physical system, subject to stringent operational constraints and limited availability of the system. Using a Bayesian approach with GP, our methods seek to select the most informative data for optimally updating an existing model. (2) We also show that black-box GP models can be used for receding horizon optimal control with probabilistic guarantees on constraint satisfaction through chance constraints. (3) We further propose an online method for continuously improving the GP model in closed-loop with a real-time controller. Our methods are demonstrated and validated in a case study of building energy control and Demand Response.}

Clinical trials for medical devices are becoming increasingly inefficient as they take several years to conduct, at very high cost and suffer from high rates of failure. For example, the Rhythm ID Goes Head-to-head Trial (RIGHT) sought to evaluate the performance of two arrhythmia discriminator algorithms for implantable cardioverter defibrillators, Vitality 2 vs. Medtronic, in terms of time-to-first inappropriate therapy, but concluded with results contrary to the initial hypothesis - after 5 years, 2,000+ patients and at considerable ethical and monetary cost. In this paper, we describe the design and performance of a computer-aided clinical trial (CACT) for Implantable Cardiac Devices where previous trial information, real patient data and closed-loop device models are effectively used to evaluate the trial with high confidence. We formulate the CACT in the context of RIGHT using a Bayesian statistical framework. We define a hierarchical model of the virtual cohort generated from a physiological model which captures the uncertainty in the parameters and allows for the systematic incorporation of information available at the design of the trial. With this formulation, the CACT estimates the inappropriate therapy rate of Vitality 2 compared to Medtronic as 33.22% vs 15.62% (p}

  abstract = {The design of bug-free and safe medical device software is challenging, especially in complex implantable devices. This is due to the device's closed-loop interaction with the patient's organs, which are stochastic physical environments. The life-critical nature and the lack of existing industry standards to enforce software validation make this an ideal domain for exploring design automation challenges for integrated functional and formal modeling with closed-loop analysis. The primary goal of high-confidence medical device software is to guarantee the device will never drive the patient into an unsafe condition even though we do not have complete understanding of the physiological plant. There are two major differences between modeling physiology and modeling man-made systems: first, physiology is much more complex and less well-understood than man-made systems like cars and airplanes, and spans several scales from the molecular to the entire human body. Secondly, the variability between humans is orders of magnitude larger than that between two cars coming off the assembly line. Using the implantable cardiac pacemaker as an example of closed-loop device, and the heart as the organ to be modeled, we present several of the challenges and early results in model-based device validation. We begin with detailed timed automata model of the pacemaker, based on the specifications and algorithm descriptions from Boston Scientific. For closed-loop evaluation, a real-time Virtual Heart Model (VHM) has been developed to model the electrophysiological operation of the functioning and malfunctioning (i.e., during arrhythmia) hearts. By extracting the timing properties of the heart and pacemaker device, we present a methodology to construct timed-automata models for formal model checking and functional testing of the closed-loop system. The VHM's capability of generating clinically-relevant response has been validated for a variety of common arrhythmias. Based on a set of requirements, we describe a framework of Abstraction Trees that allows for interactive and physiologically relevant closed-loop model checking and testing for basic pacemaker device operations such as maintaining the heart rate, atrial-ventricle synchrony and complex conditions such as avoiding pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. Through automatic model translation of abstract models to simulation-based testing and code generation for platform-level testing, this model-based design approach ensures the closed-loop safety properties are retained through the design toolchain and facilitates the development of verified software from verified models. This system is a step toward a validation and testing approach for medical cyber-physical systems with the patient-in-the-loop.}

However, a key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC in buildings, is the cost, time, and effort associated with learning first-principles based dynamical models of the underlying physical system. This paper introduces an alternative approach for implementing finite-time receding horizon control using control-oriented data-driven models. We call this approach Data Predictive Control (DPC). Specifically, by utilizing separation of variables, two novel algorithms for implementing DPC using a single regression tree and with regression trees ensembles (random forest) are presented. The data predictive controller enables the building operator to trade off energy consumption against thermal comfort without having to learn white/grey box models of the systems dynamics. We present a comprehensive numerical study which compares the performance of DPC with an MPC based energy management strategy, using a single zone building model. Our results demonstrate that performance of DPC is comparable to an MPC controller, with only 3.8% additional cost in terms of optimal objective function and within 95% in terms of R2 score, thereby making it an alluring alternative to MPC, whenever the associated cost of learning the model is high.}

However, a key factor prohibiting the widespread adoption of MPC, is the cost, time, and effort associated with learning first-principles dynamical models of the underlying physical system. An alternative approach is to employ learning algorithms to build black-box models which rely only on real-time data from the sensors. Machine learning is widely used for regression and classification, but thus far data-driven models have not been used for closed-loop control. We present novel Data Predictive Control (DPC) algorithms that use Regression Trees and Random Forests for receding horizon control. We demonstrate the strength of our approach with a case study on a bilinear building model identified using real weather data and sensor measurements. In a one-to-one comparison, we show that DPC explains 70\% variation in the MPC controller. We further apply DPC to a large scale multi-story EnergyPlus building model to curtail total power consumption in a Demand Response setting. In such cases, when the model-based controllers fail due to modeling cost, complexity and scalability, our results show that DPC curtails the desired power usage with high confidence.}

  abstract = {Hybrid energy systems consist of a load powered by a source and a form of energy storage. Systems with mixed energy supply find applications in the electric grid with renewable and non-renewable sources, in mission critical systems such as Mars rovers with rechargeable and non-rechargeable batteries and low-power monitoring systems with energy harvesting. A general problem for hybrid energy systems is the reduction of peak power consumption to ensure cost-efficient operation as peak power draws require additional resources, adversely affect the system reliability and storage lifetime. Furthermore, in some cases such as electric vehicles, the load dynamics are fast, not perfectly known a priori and the computation power available is often limited, making the implementation of traditional optimal control difficult. This paper aims to develop a control scheme to reduce the peak power drawn from the source for hybrid energy systems with limited computation power and limited load forecasts. We propose a scheme with two control levels and provide a sufficient condition for control of the different energy storage/generation components to meet the instantaneous load while satisfying a peak power threshold. The scheme provides performance comparable to Model Predictive Control, while requiring less computation power and only coarse-grained load predictions. As a case study we implement the scheme for a battery-supercapacitor system in an electric vehicle with real world drive cycles to demonstrate the low execution time and effective reduction of the battery power (hence temperature), which is crucial to the lifetime of the battery.}

  abstract = {Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a well-consolidated technique to design optimal control strategies, leveraging the capability of a mathematical model to predict the system’s behavior over a predictive horizon. However, building physics-based models for large-scale systems, such as buildings and process control, can be cost and time prohibitive. To overcome this problem we propose in this paper a methodology to exploit machine learning techniques (i.e. regression trees and random forests) in order to build a state-space switched affine dynamical model of a large scale system only using historical data. Finite Receding Horizon Control (RHC) setup using control-oriented data-driven models based on regression trees and random forests is presented as well. A comparison with an optimal MPC benchmark and a related methodology is provided on an energy management system to show the performance of the proposed modeling framework. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is very close to the optimum and provides better performance with respect to the related methodology in terms of cost function optimization.}

  abstract = {Implantable cardiac devices like pacemakers and defibrillators are life-saving medical devices. To verify their functionality, there is a need for heart models that can simulate interesting phenomena and are relatively computationally tractable. In this benchmark we implement a model of the electrical activity in excitable cardiac tissue as a network of nonlinear hybrid automata. The model has previously been shown to simulate fast arrhythmias. The hybrid automata are arranged in a square n-by-n grid and communicate via their voltages. Our Matlab implementation allows the user to specify any size of model $n$, thus rendering it ideal for benchmarking purposes since we can study tool efficiency as a function of size. We expect the model to be used to analyze parameter ranges and network connectivity that lead to dangerous heart conditions. It can also be connected to device models for device verification.}

  abstract = {In this effort we investigate the design and use of physiological and device models to conduct pre-clinical trials to provide early insight in the design and execution of the actual clinical trial. Computer models of physiological phenomena like cardiac electrical activity can be extremely complex. However, when the purpose of the model is to interact with a medical device, then it becomes sufficient to model the measurements that the device makes, e.g. the intra-cardiac electrograms (EGMs) that an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD) measures. We present a probabilistic generative model of EGMs, capable of generating exemplars of various arrhythmias. The model uses deformable shape templates, or motifs, to capture the variability in EGM shapes within one EGM channel, and a cycle length parameter to capture the variability in cycle length in one EGM channel. The relation between EGM channels, which is essential for determining whether the current arrhythmia is potentially fatal, is captured by a time-delayed Markov chain, whose states model the various combinations of (learned) motifs. The heart model is minimally parameterized and is learned from real patient data. Thus the statistics of key features reflect the statistics of a real cohort, but the model can also generate rare cases and new combinations from the inferred probabilities. On the device end, algorithms for signal sensing, detection and discrimination for major ICD manufacturers have been implemented both in simulation and on hardware platforms. The generated arrhythmia episodes are used as input to both the modeled ICD algorithms and real ICDs as part of a Computer Aided Clinical Trial (CACT). In a CACT, a computer model simulates the inputs to the device (such as a new, investigational ICD), and the device’s performance is evaluated. By incorporating these results into the appropriate statistical framework, the Computer Aided Clinical Trial results can serve as regulatory evidence when planning and executing an actual clinical trial. We demonstrate this by conducting a mock trial similar to the 2005-2010 RIGHT trial which compared the discrimination algorithms from two major ICD manufacturers. The results of the CACT clearly demonstrate that the failed outcome of the RIGHT trial could have been predicted and provides statistical support for deeper results that could have been captured prior to the trial.},

The challenge with using data-driven approaches, is to close the loop for near real-time control and decision making in large buildings. Furthermore, providing a technological solution alone is not enough, the solution must also be human centric. We consider the problem of end-user demand response for commercial buildings. Using historical data from the building, we build a family of regression trees based models for predicting the power consumption of the building in real-time. We have built DR-Advisor, a recommender system for the building's facilities manager, which provides optimal control actions to meet the required load curtailment while maintaining building operations and maximizing the economic reward.}

For example, implantable cardiac pacemakers have over 80,000 lines of code which are responsible for maintaining the heart within safe operating limits. As firmware-related recalls accounted for over 41% of the 600,000 devices recalled in the last decade, there is a need for rigorous model-driven design tools to generate verified code from verified software models. To this effect we have developed the UPP2SF model-translation tool, which facilitates automatic conversion of verified models (in UPPAAL) to models that may be simulated and tested (in Simulink/Stateflow). We describe the translation rules that ensure correct model conversion, applicable to a large class of models. We demonstrate how UPP2SF is used in the model-driven design of a pacemaker whose model is (a) designed and verified in UPPAAL (using timed automata), (b) automatically translated to Stateflow for simulation-based testing, and then (c) automatically generated into modular code for hardware-level integration testing of timing-related errors. In addition, we show how UPP2SF may be used for worst-case execution time estimation early in the design stage. Using UPP2SF, we demonstrate the value of integrated end-to-end modeling, verification, code-generation and testing process for complex software-controlled embedded systems.}

  abstract = {Implantable cardiac pacemakers restore normal heart rhythm by delivering external electrical pacing to the heart. The pacemaker software is life-critical as the timing of the pulses determine its ability to control the heart rate. Recalls due to software issues have been on the rise with the increasing complexity of pacing algorithms. Open-loop testing remains the primary approach to evaluate the safety of pacemaker software. While this tests how the pacemaker responds to stimulus, it cannot reveal pacemaker malfunctions which drive the heart into an unsafe state over multiple cycles. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of pacemaker software we have developed a heart model to generate different heart conditions and interact with real pacemakers. In this paper, we introduce the closed-loop testing platform which consists of a programmable hardware implementation of the heart that can interact with a commercial pacemaker in closed-loop. The heart-on-a-chip implementation is automatically generated from the Virtual Heart Model in Simulink which models different heart conditions. We describe a case study of Endless Loop Tachycardia to demonstrate potential closed-loop pacemaker malfunctions which inappropriately increase the heart rate. The test platform is part of our model-based design framework for verification and testing of medical devices with the patient--in-the-loop.}

  abstract = {As methods and tools for Cyber-Physical Systems grow in capabilities and use, one-size-fits-all solutions start to show their limitations. In particular, tools and languages for programming an algorithm or modeling a CPS that are specific to the application domain are typically more usable, and yield better performance, than general-purpose languages and tools. In the domain of cardiac arrhythmia monitoring, a small, implantable medical device continuously monitors the patient's cardiac rhythm and delivers electrical therapy when needed. The algorithms executed by these devices are streaming algorithms, so they are best programmed in a streaming language that allows the programmer to reason about the incoming data stream as the basic object, rather than force her to think about lower-level details like state maintenance and minimization. Because these devices are resource-constrained, it is useful if the programming language allowed predictable performance in terms of processing runtime and energy consumption, or more general costs. StreamQRE is a declarative streaming programming language, with an efficient and portable implementation and strong theoretical guarantees. In particular, its evaluation algorithm guarantees constant cost (runtime, memory, energy) per data item, and also calculates upper bounds on the per-item cost. Such an estimate of the cost allows early exploration of the algorithmic possibilities, while maintaining a handle on worst-case performance, on the basis of which hardware can be designed and algorithms can be tuned.}

  abstract = {Robustness-Guided Falsification (RGF) is an efficient

testing technique that tries to find a system execution that

violates some formal specification, by minimizing the robustness

of the specification over the set of initial conditions of the

system. Robustness uses an underlying distance function on

the space of system executions. As RGF is applied to new fields

like medicine, it is essential to determine whether our distances

still capture the domain expert’s intuition of which executions

are similar and which are not. Motivated by the problem of

testing the algorithms of cardiac defibrillators implanted in

millions of patients worldwide, this work develops a (pseudo-

)distance function, called conformance, over the space of cardiac

signals. By using it to distinguish between fatal and non-fatal

arrhythmias obtained from real patients, it is demonstrated

that conformance measures the meaningful distance between

cardiac signals much better than distances used in medical

devices today. Next, conformance is used to re-define the

robustness degrees of Metric Temporal Logic (MTL), and it

is shown that conformance-based robust semantics of MTL

can bound the (conformance-based) robustness degree, thus

enabling a principled application of RGF to problems in the

cardiac domain, using the appropriate distance notion. Using

existing robust semantics based on sup norm can yield incorrect

conclusions, with potentially severe consequences to patients.}

Feedback linearization has reduced the computational burden, but has not yet been solved for robust model predictive control under estimation errors and constraints. In this paper, we solve this problem of robust control of a non-linear system under bounded state estimation errors and input and state constraints using feedback linearization. We do so by developing robust constraints on the feedback linearized system such that the non-linear system respects its constraints. These constraints are computed at run-time using online reachability, and are linear in the optimization variables, resulting in a Quadratic Program with linear constraints. We also provide robust feasibility, recursive feasibility and stability results for our control algorithm. We evaluate our approach on two systems to show its applicability and performance.}

  abstract = {Peak power consumption is a universal problem across energy control systems in electrical grids, buildings, and industrial automation where the uncoordinated operation of multiple controllers result in temporally correlated electricity demand surges (or peaks). While there exist several different approaches to balance power consumption by load shifting and load shedding, they operate on coarse grained time scales and do not help in de-correlating energy sinks. The Energy System Scheduling Problem is particularly hard due to its binary control variables. Its complexity grows exponentially with the scale of the system, making it impossible to handle systems with more than a few variables.

We developed a scalable approach for fine-grained scheduling of energy control systems that novelly combines techniques from control theory and computer science. The original system with binary control variables are approximated by an averaged system whose inputs are the utilization values of the binary inputs within a given period. The error between the two systems can be bounded, which allows us to derive a safety constraint for the averaged system so that the original system's safety is guaranteed. To further reduce the complexity of the scheduling problem, we abstract the averaged system by a simple single-state single-input dynamical system whose control input is the upper-bound of the total demand of the system. This model abstraction is achieved by extending the concept of simulation relations between transition systems to allow for input constraints between the systems. We developed conditions to test for simulation relations as well as algorithms to compute such a model abstraction. As a consequence, we only need to solve a small linear program to compute an optimal bound of the total demand. The total demand is then broken down, by solving a linear program much smaller than the original program, to individual utilization values of the subsystems, whose actual schedule is then obtained by a low-level scheduling algorithm. Numerical simulations in Matlab show the effectiveness and scalability of our approach.}

  abstract = {Real-time electricity pricing and demand response has become a clean, reliable and cost-effective way of mitigating peak demand on the electricity grid. We consider the problem of end-user demand response (DR) for large commercial buildings which involves predicting the demand response baseline, evaluating fixed DR strategies and synthesizing DR control actions for load curtailment in return for a financial reward. Using historical data from the building, we build a family of regression trees and learn data-driven models for predicting the power consumption of the building in real-time. We present a method called DR-Advisor called DR-Advisor, which acts as a recommender system for the building's facilities manager and provides suitable control actions to meet the desired load curtailment while maintaining operations and maximizing the economic reward. We evaluate the performance of DR-Advisor for demand response using data from a real office building and a virtual test-bed.}
